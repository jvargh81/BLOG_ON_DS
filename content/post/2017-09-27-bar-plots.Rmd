** Lets go through another kinda of graph called the Bar graph. **

_Inserting libraries to use for the plots_
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggiraph)

```

** Lets create a table for creating a bar graph.**

<span style="color:red"> *Note : Bar graph are also single value graphs, but we can use x axis to display name or etc of that kind.* text</span>

```{r}
df<-Teams%>%
  #filtering all the data for 1980 
  filter(yearID == 1980)%>%
  select(name,HR)%>%
  #Arranging all data in asscending order, but we have to factor it 
  #inorder to display on the bargraph.
  arrange(HR)
```

** We are just trying to plot the graph after using arrange api.**

```{r}
ggplot()+
  # (dont do grouping or tallying))stat = identity means ggplot will do tallying for us.
  geom_bar(data=df,aes(x=name,y=HR),color="white",fill="purple",stat = "identity")+
  # Since the names are big and it will not fit all together, we can flip it over
  #using the below api.
  coord_flip()
```
<span style="color:red">*Note : The above graph is not arranged, though using arrange api. We have to factor it inorder to arrange the data.* text</span>

** Converting to factors or categorising it.**
```{r}
# In this way we get arranged graph by leveling it w.r.t to the HR , rather than a up and down bar graph.
df$name<-factor(df$name,levels=df$name)
```


** Now lets plot the graph using ggplot after arranging **

```{r}
ggplot()+
  # (dont do grouping or tallying))stat = identity means ggplot will do tallying for us.
  geom_bar(data=df,aes(x=name,y=HR),color="white",fill="purple",stat = "identity")+
  # Since the names are big and it will not fit all together, we can flip it over
  #using the below api.
  coord_flip()
```
