#### Data visualization using ggplot and ggiraph.

_Using ggplot, we can display the data using graphs. In this post we will 
be going through histogram graph._

 * Let's inherit some libraries to start with


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(Lahman) 
library(devtools)
library(blogdown)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggiraph)

```

* Histogram is used to analyse a single type of data.We can analyse one type of
category, for example weight in this case.

```{r}
df<-Master%>%
  # this helps to eliminate a empty entry.Here we are filtering only the one with value of weight.
  filter(!is.na(weight))%>%
  select(weight)
  
```

* Lets plot the histogram using ggplot.

```{r}
ggplot()+
  #Here we will be using geom_histogram API for ploting the graph.
  #Here we won't use y axis as, we have only one category of value.
  geom_histogram(data=df,aes(x=weight),color="white",fill="blue",bins=40)+
  ggtitle("Baseball player weights")

```
